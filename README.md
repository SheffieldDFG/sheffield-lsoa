# sheffield-lsoa

LSOA boundaries for Sheffield

Downloaded shapefile from
[Lower Layer Super Output Areas (December 2011) Generalised
Clipped Boundaries in England and
Wales](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-layer-super-output-areas-december-2011-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-england-and-wales).

Then converted it to CSV using
[shpit](https://github.com/SheffieldDFG/shpit).

Then extracted just the Sheffield part using `sed`.

That resulted in the file here.
